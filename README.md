# Latest PettingZoo Wrappers for SMAC and SMACv2

We wrap [SMAC](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac) and [SMACv2](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smacv2) with parallel apis of PettingZoo.

Note that we include the modifications of SMAC and SMACv2 in [MAPPO](https://github.com/marlbenchmark/on-policy/tree/main) for reproducing the SOTA results.
